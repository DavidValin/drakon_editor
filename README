DRAKON
======
DRAKON is is an algorithmic visual programming language developed within the Buran space project.
Beside programming, DRAKON is also used in medicine, law, business processes and in other non-programming related fields.
The rules of DRAKON are optimized to ensure easy understanding by human beings. In DRAKON clarity is above all. DRAKON is made as much ergonomic as possible, as much human readable as possible. DRAKON makes possible to create diagrams that are cognitively optimized for easy comprehension, making it a tool for intelligence augmentation.

Why to use DRAKON than other diagramming systems?
- No line intersections. You will never find in DRAKON diagram two or more lines intersecting each other! Not seen in other diagramming systems!
- Silhouette structure. It allows to break one diagram in to several logical parts. Not seen in other diagramming systems!
- No slanting or curved lines. Only straight lines with right angles.
- Icons are placed only on vertical lines.
- Branching is done in a simple, visible and consistent way.
- Each diagram has one entry and one exit.
